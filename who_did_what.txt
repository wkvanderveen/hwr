Emile: 		Sliding window for backup_cnn; 
			overall pipeline for yolo (splitting data, augmenting data, making training lines, training and testing pipeline, etc)
			Data reader for backup_cnn
			Training networks

Roberts:	Write_to_file

Tomas:		Preprocessing (all of it); 
			post processing

Werner:		Changing Yolo to trian well on our data (a lot); 
			post processing (Naive Bayes); 
			overall pipeline for yolo (splitting data, augmenting data, making training lines, training and testing pipeline, etc)
			Finding correct configuration hyperparameters and network layout (largest contribution)
			Training networks

Ruben: 		Initial setup Yolo; 
			backup_cnn & data reader; 
			sliding window approach for backup cnn
			Finding correct configuration hyperparameters and network layout (smaller contribution)
			overall pipeline for yolo (splitting data, augmenting data, making training lines, training and testing pipeline, etc) (smaller contribution)
			Training networks
